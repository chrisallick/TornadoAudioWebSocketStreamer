Use pyaudio to record audio and then pack it into a base64 string and stream it to the web via WebSockets.

On the front end it's a pure JavaScript implementation of the audio player.

After making this I realized there might not actually be an application... huh :)

1) run the python server
$>python main.py

2) open up chrome and navigate to http://localhost:8888

3) O_O wait for it...

4) wait, then start talking.
